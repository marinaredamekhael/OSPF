# OSPF Protocol Functional Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This GitHub repository offers an in-depth study of the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol's key functionalities within computer networks.

## Key Aspects Explored
1. **LSA Generation and Sharing**
   - Description: Analysis of how routers create and share LSAs, including the cost metrics for paths.
2. **Link State Database (LSDB)**
   - Description: Examination of the LSDB's role in maintaining up-to-date routing information.
3. **Sequence Numbers**
   - Description: Investigation of LSA sequence numbers for tracking the most recent data.
4. **Forwarding Table Computation**
   - Description: Assessment of how routers compute optimal routing paths based on LSA data.
5. **Consistency in Timing**
   - Description: Analysis of the uniform timing in LSA processing, observed during simulations.
6. **Network Map Accuracy**
   - Description: Verification of the accuracy of routers' network understanding against established connections.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive understanding of OSPF's crucial mechanisms, contributing to the field of computer networking.
